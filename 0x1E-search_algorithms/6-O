Primary Array Allocation:
map = malloc(sizeof(int *) * n);
This line allocates an array of n pointers to int. The space complexity for this is 
ùëÇ(n)

Secondary Array Allocations:
Inside the loop, map[i] = malloc(sizeof(int) * m);
For each of the n pointers, this line allocates an array of m integers.
The space complexity for each of these allocations is 
O(m).
Since there are n such allocations, the total space complexity for these allocations is 
O(n√óm).

Total Space Complexity:
Combining the two components, the total space complexity of the function is 
O(n+n√óm)
